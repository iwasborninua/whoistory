    I'd like to thank [Bergfreunde GmbH](https://www.bergfreunde.de/), a German
    online retailer for Outdoor Gear & Clothing, for sponsoring the first release! ðŸŽ‰
    Thanks to sponsors like this, who understand the importance of open source
    development, I can justify spending time and focus on open source development
    instead of traditional paid work.
